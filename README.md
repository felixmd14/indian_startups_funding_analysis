# Indian Start-up Ecosystem Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the Indian start-up ecosystem from 2018 to 2021. The goal of this project is to understand the landscape of the Indian start-up ecosystem and identify potential areas of opportunity for our team's development.

## Data

The data used in this analysis is sourced from publicly available datasets on Indian start-ups. The data includes information on funding, sectors, and other relevant metrics.

## Methodology

To accomplish the task of suggesting a suitable plan of action for our team's development, we have followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. The steps we followed include:

1. **Business Understanding**: We defined our research goal and formulated hypotheses to test.
2. **Data Understanding**: We collected and explored the datasets from 2018 to 2021, identifying inconsistencies and variations that required preprocessing.
3. **Data Preparation**: We adjusted column names, merged datasets, and converted rupee values to dollars for consistency.
4. **Data Analysis**: We conducted an in-depth analysis to address research questions and test hypotheses.
5. **Results Evaluation**: We evaluated the findings and drew conclusions based on the analysis.

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis**: Fintech is not the most lucrative sector, as it does not receive the most significant amount of funding in the Indian start-up ecosystem.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: Fintech is the most lucrative sector, receiving the most significant funding in the Indian start-up ecosystem.

## Research Questions

1. Which sector received the most funding from 2018 to 2021?
2. How does funding for the fintech sector compare to other sectors in the Indian start-up ecosystem over the same period?
3. Have there been any significant fintech funding deals from 2018 to 2021?
4. What are the top 10 sectors that received the most funding during the period?
5. How many fintech start-up companies received funding compared to other companies in the top 10 sectors?
6. How does the average amount of funding received by fintech start-ups compare to the average amount of funding received by start-ups in other sectors in the Indian start-up ecosystem over the same period?
7. Have the investment trends in the Indian start-up ecosystem shown a preference for fintech companies over other sectors from 2018 to 2021?

## Results

Our analysis has uncovered some interesting insights on the Indian start-up ecosystem. To summarize, we have failed to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Fintech is the most lucrative sector receiving the most significant funding in the Indian start-up ecosystem. However, the analysis has provided valuable insights into funding distribution, prominent sectors, and investment trends within the Indian start-up ecosystem.
